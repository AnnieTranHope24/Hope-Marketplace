Folders: css, images, includes (with common php functions), js (javaScript files),
partials (footer, head, header), UPLOADS (photos)

We included the common_functions.php when we wanted to use the fucntions related to cart.
We included the partials in almost all of the php pages as most of them need the three elements.

Main database: hopemarketplace.sql that includes 3 tables: items, credentials, and cart
